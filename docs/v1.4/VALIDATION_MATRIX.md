# HallJoy v1.4 validation matrix

## Gate definitions

| Gate | Purpose | Minimum evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `S` | Source and static correctness | Project parse, static audits, dependency and manifest checks |
| `P` | Portable behavioral tests | GCC and Clang C++20 tests, warnings, ASan and UBSan |
| `W` | Windows build/runtime | Clean MSVC x64 Release build, launch, clean shutdown, second launch |
| `F` | Failure and lifecycle | Injected partial start, timeout, exception, cancellation and restart |
| `H` | Hardware | Protocol-specific input, hotplug, held-key unplug and ViGEm output |
| `R` | Release | Clean checkout/package, hashes, notices, CI, soak and device matrix |

## Current baseline evidence

Date: 2026-07-31

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Original archive path safety | PASS | 0 unsafe ZIP entries |
| Archive SHA-256 | PASS | `39727D2F63165F63B2AC0AA8105DBF4937C02442D09B0F8FA800F195D502A4CF` |
| Clean import comparison | PASS | 344 files, 0 missing or hash mismatches |
| Imported archive static audits | PASS | All supplied static audits completed |
| Imported archive x64 Release build | PASS | 0 errors, 1 ViGEm PDB linker warning |
| v1.3 checkpoint x64 Release build | PASS | 0 errors, 6 recorded warnings |
| Portable tests with Clang 19.1.5 | PASS | All static and portable C++20 tests passed |
| GCC portable tests | INHERITED/PENDING | Byte-identical archive evidence exists; rerun in CI before publication |
| Windows UI smoke from integration branch | PASS | Window opened, ViGEm initialized, exit code 0, no remaining child process |
| Stability trace | WARN | Expected: no SparkLink device was exercised on this workstation |
| Hardware gates | PENDING | Required only by packages that touch the corresponding backend |

The workstation uses a membrane keyboard. The planned simulator can satisfy
common-pipeline behavioral gates, but never a protocol-specific hardware gate.

## Per-package evidence template

Every completed package appends:

```text
Package:
Commit:
Scope:
Commands:
Results:
Warnings:
Hardware:
Known limitations:
Rollback:
```

Historical PASS reports do not automatically verify changed v1.4 code. A gate
must be rerun whenever its covered code or build inputs change.

## V14-01 evidence

```text
Package: V14-01
Scope: Product identity and active documentation ownership
Commands:
  python tools/run_native_backend_checks.py --require-compiler
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\build.ps1
Results:
  Static audits: PASS
  Portable C++20 tests (Clang 19.1.5): PASS
  MSVC x64 Release: PASS, 0 errors, 1 inherited ViGEm PDB warning
  EXE FileVersion: 1.4.0.0
  EXE ProductVersion: 1.4.0.0
Hardware: Not required; runtime protocol behavior was unchanged
Known limitations: GCC reruns in CI before publication
Rollback: parent commit of the V14-01 implementation commit
```
