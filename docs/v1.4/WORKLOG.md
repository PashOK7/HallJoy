# HallJoy v1.4 worklog

## 2026-07-31 - V14-00 baseline and provenance

### Inputs

- GitHub baseline: `v1.3`, commit `2467cb7`.
- Local v1.3 SDK checkpoint: commit `b3fefce`.
- Imported archive:
  `C:\Users\Proizvodstvo\Downloads\HallJoy_STABILITY_S02V1_VERIFICATION_TRACE.zip`.
- Archive SHA-256:
  `39727D2F63165F63B2AC0AA8105DBF4937C02442D09B0F8FA800F195D502A4CF`.

### Completed

- Verified GitHub authentication for account `PashOK7`; no push performed.
- Built the v1.3 SDK checkpoint with MSVC x64 Release: 0 errors, 6 warnings.
- Preserved the checkpoint on `checkpoint/v1.3-self-contained-sdk`.
- Re-extracted the source archive into a clean import directory.
- Compared 344 source-package files by SHA-256: 0 mismatches.
- Imported the archive on `v1.4-integration` as commit `f5e8c18`.
- Established the authoritative v1.4 documentation set.
- Rebuilt the imported branch with MSVC x64 Release: 0 errors and 1 vendored
  ViGEm PDB warning.
- Added the existing Build Tools Clang 19.1.5 directory to the user `PATH`.
- Passed all supplied static and portable C++20 tests with Clang.
- Installed ViGEmBus 1.22.0 through its hash-verified winget package.
- Passed UI startup and graceful shutdown with ViGEm initialized; exit code was
  0 and no analog-host child remained.
- Received the expected trace `WARN` because no SparkLink hardware was
  exercised. There were no backend or ViGEm failures after driver installation.
- Ignored the generated private UAP `.build-tools` directory so a clean build
  does not contaminate the Git worktree.

### Baseline observations

- The imported architecture embeds a private UAP and does not use the system
  Wooting SDK at runtime.
- The private plugin is currently extracted beside the executable. This can
  fail in a protected directory.
- Legacy dependency code may then recommend installing the system SDK, which
  cannot repair the embedded private UAP path.
- The imported risk register contains 44 open and 1 partial risks.
- The build bootstraps Sun from a moving branch; Soup itself is commit-pinned.

### Next

- Apply `V14-01` version identity changes.
- Add the `V14-02` development-only deterministic analog simulator.
- Begin `V14-03` self-contained UAP runtime and dependency diagnostics.
